As indicated before, when you buy or sell stock shares, money will come out of or go into your bank account. These activities should all be recorded in your bank account transaction history (as withdrawal or deposit, respectively).
Please have the following options:
1. View account balance – Prints out the account balance.
2. Deposit Money – The user selects the amount of money to deposit. This amount should be added to the balance.
3. Withdraw Money – The user selects the amount of money to withdraw. If the balance of the account is not sufficient to withdraw the amount, please print out an error.
4. Print out history - The program should print out the history of transactions on
the account in order of transaction time.

Example: Event Deposit Withdrawal Deposit
Amount $500.00 $1000.00 $1500.00

(Here we assume there is no stock transaction in this example; otherwise, stock transactions should also be printed for the bank account.)
Extra credit
Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the program. You can use whatever C++ libraries (such as MFC, QT or fltk) you choose to do this. If you decide to do this please create it in a separate project (in FinalProject_gui_yourname.zip) and also submit the non-graphical version of the program. (up to 20 extra points)
Submission Guidelines
1. Give a brief description of your project, the functions you have implemented, data structures used, text files used or created and for what purpose and any other descriptions of your project. If you made any extra features for the program please clearly state it. Include the description in a Word file.
2. For the submission, please submit the entire project folder in a zip/rar file, FinalProject_yourname.zip. Make sure you comment your code. Your visual studio project should be named FinalProject_yourname. Please make sure all the cpp filenames have your name in it.
3. Do not copy code from ANY other people. The project should be your own work. Otherwise, you will FAIL the course.
